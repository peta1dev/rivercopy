#River Copy

In this project, I was required to use flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. 

The page had to include:

- A title and logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
- A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

The project had to use flexbox styling for layout, aiming to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

The page also needed to use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.
